# glTF Viewer

An application for demonstrating the practical usage of [fx-gltf](https://github.com/jessey-git/fx-gltf) within the context of a modern rendering project.

## Features
* Lightly abstracted DirectX 12 rendering
    * Enough abstraction to get out of the way, but not too much so-as to interfere with learning
* Auto mesh coloring for easy debugging/experimentation
* PBR materials with image-based lighting (IBL)

## Usage
```
A simple glTF2.0 scene viewer using DirectX 12
Usage: viewer.exe [OPTIONS] file

Positionals:
  file TEXT (REQUIRED)   Scene to load (.gltf or .glb)

Options:
  -h,--help              Print this help message and exit
  --width INT            Initial window width
  --height INT           Initial window height
  -r,--rotate            Auto rotate model
  -m,--materials         Enable model materials
  -i,--ibl               Enable IBL
  -g,--ground            Enable ground plane
  -x FLOAT               Camera x position
  -y FLOAT               Camera y position
  -z FLOAT               Camera z position

Controls:
  Orbit with left mouse button
  Dolly with middle mouse button
```

## Design

### Code

#### ```MeshData.h```
* Processes a given ```fx::gltf::Mesh```/```fx::gltf::Mesh::Primitive``` pair using its ```fx::gltf::Buffer``` and ```fx::gltf::Accessor``` information and exposes it in a more graphics-api friendly manner

#### ```DirectX/D3DMeshData.h```
* Uses ```MeshData``` to build the actual vertex/normal/index etc. buffers for DirectX 12
* Performs the mesh's command list drawing during scene render

#### ```DirectX/D3DGraph.h```
* Uses ```fx::gltf::Document``` and ```fx::gltf::Node``` to visit each node in the scene-graph
* Applies the node's transformation data so we can use it during update/render

#### ```DirectX/D3DEngine.h```
* Builds all DirectX 12 resources necessary for rendering
* Uses ```D3DGraph``` to build/traverse the scene-graph, building up ```D3DMeshInstance```s along the way
* Coordinates the update/render sequencing flow

### Psuedo call-graph
* Win32Application::Run
* D3DEngine / Engine
    * Initialization
        * Load and process the glTF document
            * Textures
            * Mesh pieces
            * Scene-graph
        * Compile necessary shaders to support the loaded materials
        * Establish all DirectX resources (Heaps, PSO's, constant buffers, etc.)
    * Update/Render loop
        * Set Root Signature, PSO's, constant buffers, structured buffers, etc. 
        * Draw each mesh instance
            * Set mesh constant buffers
            * Set mesh vertex/normal/index buffers
            * Perform actual draw call

### DirectX 12 / glTF Integration Notes

#### PipelineStateObject Input Layout
Most glTF files today store vertex/normal/tex-coord buffers separately from each other (non interleaved). For example, consider a simple 6 vertex mesh with vertex/normal/tex-coord formats of Vec3/Vec3/Vec2 respectively:

```[vvvvvv][nnnnnn][tttttt] == 3 buffers: [72 bytes][72 bytes][48 bytes]```

Compare this against an interleaved layout which looks as follows:

```[vntvntvntvntvntvnt] == 1 buffer: [192 bytes]```

This matters when creating the PipelineStateObject's InputLayout.  To properly use glTF data in this format without extra data manipulation, make use of the ```D3D12_INPUT_ELEMENT_DESC.InputSlot``` field.  See ```D3DEngine::BuildPipelineStateObjects``` for reference.

## Known Issues and TODOs
* General
    * Interleaved buffers from glTF are not supported currently
    * Scene centering does not seem to be working for all tested models. Some scenes still seem shifted away from 0,0,0

* DirectX 12
    * Minor: Mip-maps are not generated for the textures
    * Advanced: A memory-manager with pooling / page management should be implemented
    * Advanced: A new set of abstractions for properly batching ResourceBarriers is needed (likely requires refactoring away DeviceResources + FrameResources into finer grained objects)

* Vulkan
    * Needs implementing (patches welcome)

## Supported Compilers
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 15.6+ (and possibly earlier)
